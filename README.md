# demo.seethroughphone

This code run on your phone, it reads your camera and make your phone appears as 
transparent, aka to act as a see-through.
It may seems unrelated to 3d at first but 
it is extremely useful in augmented reality.
I know it may seem silly but this see-throught is the base of Augmented 
Reality in a phone. 

It makes your device 'appears as transparent'.
So when the user is looking at her device, she is seeing the reality.
You just have to display your augmented part on top and you got augmented reality.
A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words :)
